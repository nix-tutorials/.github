# What is nix-tutorials?

I, Illustrated_Man-code, created this Github organization as a way to create and distribute all the material I wish I had when learning all things [nix](https://nixos.org/). I am in no way officially affiliated with the NixOS organization, but I am not opposed to it! If anyone who is affiliated wants to take over oversight of this organization, I am all for it.

# Why didn't I just contribute to the wiki?

I want this to be a place where articles that are closer to blog posts can have a place. In my case, I found that there were many times where the wiki didn't give me enough background, or the manuals did not have enough concrete examples. I hope that this can be a place to aggregate guides and tutorials that do not fit as part of the wiki or manual.

# Organization structure
The [nix-tutorials](https://github.com/nix-tutorials/nix-tutorials) repository is responsible for collecting and organizing all of the content for this organization. Other repositories should be created to help this idea.
